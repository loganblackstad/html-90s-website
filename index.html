      <h1>1996 Atlanta Olympics</h1>
      <p class="page-text">
        The 1996 Summer Olympics, officially known as the Games of the XXVI
        Olympiad, commonly known as Atlanta 1996, and also referred to as the
        Centennial Olympic Games, were an international multi-sport event that
        was held from July 19 to August 4, 1996, in Atlanta, Georgia, U.S. These
        Games, which were the fourth Summer Olympics to be hosted by the United
        States, marked the centennial of the 1896 Summer Olympics in Athens—the
        inaugural edition of the modern Olympic Games. They were also the first
        since 1924 to be held in a different year from a Winter Olympics, under
        a new IOC practice implemented in 1994 to hold the Summer and Winter
        Games in alternating, even-numbered years.

        More than 10,000 athletes from 197 National Olympic Committees competed
        in 26 sports, including the Olympic debuts of beach volleyball, mountain
        biking, and softball, as well as the new disciplines of lightweight
        rowing and women's football (soccer). 24 countries made their Summer
        Olympic debut in Atlanta, including eleven former Soviet republics
        participating for the first time as independent nations. The hosting
        United States led the medal count with a total of 101 medals, and the
        most gold (44) and silver (32) medals out of all countries.

        <b>Izzy</b> was the official mascot of the Atlanta 1996 Summer Olympics.
        Initially named Whatizit ("What is it?") at its introduction at the
        close of the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, the animated character
        with the ability to morph into different forms was a departure from the
        Olympic tradition in that it did not represent a nationally-significant
        animal or human figure.

        The Games turned a profit, helped by record revenue from sponsorship
        deals and broadcast rights, and reliance on private funding (as opposed
        to the extensive public funding used on later Olympics), among other
        factors. The Games faced criticism for being overly commercialized, as
        well as other issues noted by European officials, such as the
        availability of food and transport. The event had a lasting impact on
        the city; Centennial Olympic Park led a revitalization of Atlanta's
        downtown area and has served as a symbol of the Games' legacy, the
        Olympic Village buildings have since been used as residence housing for
        area universities, and the Centennial Olympic Stadium has been
        re-developed twice since the Games—first as the baseball park Turner
        Field, and then as the college football venue Georgia State Stadium.
